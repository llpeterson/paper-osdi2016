\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

Syndicate is a real system, and is implemented in about 30,000 lines of C++ and
16,000 lines of Python. Its UGs include a FUSE filesystem interface, a suite of
shell tools, and a RESTful Node.js server. Its RGs come with logic to leverage
to several cloud storage providers, including Amazon S3, Google Drive, and
Dropbox. The AGs come with logic to interact with GenBank, M-Lab, and iRODS
deployments.

\subsection{Operationalization}

To help manage Syndicate at scale, we built an automount service that allows
users to specify a ``provisioning plan'' that describes which volumes are
to be mounted on the hosts they control. The automount client manages the
details of provisioning, starting and stopping the correct gateways, and polling
for changes in the provision plan.

By default, the provisioning plan is hosted in the user's Blockstack-secured
profile, which itself is replicated across the back-end storage providers of the
user's choice.  This means that the automount client only needs to know
the username to look up, and Blockstack guarantees that the client always
fetches the latest authentic provisioning plan.
