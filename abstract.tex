   This paper presents a software-defined approach to synthesizing stable
   wide-area storage from unstable legacy services by fully separating storage
   features from storage providers. With our prototype system, called
   Syndicate, developers implement and compose reusable storage features that
   run on top of any provider, allowing them to find the optimal storage
   cost/performance trade-off while isolating applications from service
   instability and lock-in.  The main contribution is a blockchain-based
   protocol for enforcing correct storage behavior across multiple untrusted
   administrative domains without relying on a single point of trust.

   We present an evaluation of Syndicate's overhead and development
   cost-savings by implementing three non-trivial applications with
   highly-specific storage features using only commodity providers. Each
   storage feature is reusable, and required less than 500 lines of Python to
   implement.
